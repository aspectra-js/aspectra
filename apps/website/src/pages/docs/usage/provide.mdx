# @provide

`providers` can be injected using the `@provide` decorator.

Regardless of how many times a `provider` is injected, the same instance will
be returned each time. Don't worry about creating multiple instances of the
same `provider`, simply inject wherever you need it.

```typescript filename="src/index.ts"
import { application, provide } from 'aspectra'
import { Database } from './providers/database'

@application
class Application {
  @provide(Database)
  private readonly database!: Database

  @provide(Database)
  private readonly other!: Database // same instance as above

  public start() {
    console.log(this.database.getAll())
  }
}
```

```bash
tsx src/index.ts # Output: ['item1', 'item2']
```
