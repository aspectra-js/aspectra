# @application

This is the entry point of the application. It will instantiate the class and
call the `start` method.

```typescript filename="src/index.ts"
import { application } from 'aspectra'

@application
class Application {
  public start() {
    console.log('Hello, world!')
  }
}

// equivalent to
const app = new Application()
app.start()
```

Which can be run with:

```bash
tsx src/index.ts
```
