import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'

# @application

The `@application` decorator marks the entry point of your aspectra-based
application. It instantiates the class it decorates and calls its `start`
method automatically.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Lack of `start` method will result in a compile-time error.
</Callout>

#### Example

```typescript filename="src/index.ts"
import { application } from 'aspectra'

@application
class Application {
  public start() {
    console.log('Hello, world!')
  }
}
```

This is functionally equivalent to:

```typescript
const app = new Application()
app.start()
```

#### Running the Application

Run your application using:

```bash
tsx src/index.ts
```
